# Determining the Impact of Socio-Economic Factors on ACT/SAT Scores
Repository for DATA 3320 project 2.

# Project Description
This project will apply regression analysis to determine how various socio-economic factors correlate to a school's average SAT and ACT scores. This process will determine a predictive model that can estimate what a school's typical SAT/ACT score will be given their socio-economic information.

# Data
Two datasets will be used. The first is from EdGap, which sources standardized test scores from each state's department of education. EdGap also tracks socio-economic factors by zip code through the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey. EdGap Data can be viewed at: https://github.com/joeyuy/Education-Inequality/blob/main/EdGap_data.xlsx

The second dataset is from the National Center for Education Statistics which provides additional information for each school. The data can be viewed at: https://drive.usercontent.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1HvW2w-o2XZzCm4KTvnb1Bb3BvoAa14BP&export=download

Both datasets uniquely identify each school via the NCESSCH School ID.
